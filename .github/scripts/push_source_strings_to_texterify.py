"""
Push hypha/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po to Texterify via its API (txty-cli has
no bulk push/import command, only `download` and `add`).

Overwrites the source language's content unconditionally. This is safe for the source
locale (English) as its msgstr is always blank, with no authored content. Please note
the same call would clobber authored work for any other language.

Import is additive only, but a key removed from the codebase is reported as an orphan
after every push, and can be removed from Texterify if the `TXTY_PRUNE_ORPHAN_KEYS` var
is set (see report_orphan_keys method).

Required environment variables:
    TXTY_AUTH_EMAIL, TXTY_AUTH_SECRET  - from the Texterify access token page
    TXTY_PROJECT_ID                    - the Texterify project id

Optional environment variables:
    TXTY_SOURCE_LANGUAGE_NAME - how the source language is named in the
        Texterify project's Languages settings (default: "en")
    TXTY_SOURCE_PO_FILE - path to the .po file to push
        (default: hypha/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po)
    TXTY_PRUNE_ORPHAN_KEYS - set to "true" to actually delete orphan keys
        found after the push, instead of just reporting them (default: unset)
